deployment:
  tasks:
    # 1) Define target public directory
    - export DEPLOYPATH=/home/khehlac/public_html/

    # 2) Clear old deployment (but keep public_html folder itself)
    - /bin/rm -rf $DEPLOYPATH/*

    # 3) Copy files & folders from repo to public_html
    - /bin/cp -R assets $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp -R components $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp index.html $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp quote.html $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp README.md $DEPLOYPATH

    # 4) Create a deployment timestamp (helps debugging)
    - echo "Deployed on $(date)" > $DEPLOYPATH/.last_deployed
